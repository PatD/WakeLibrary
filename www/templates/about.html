        <p>
          By using this mobile app, <strong>you swear to never bother any of the hard-working staff at Wake County Public Libraries</strong>.
          They didn't make this app.</p><p>
          They're far too busy proiding an excellent public service to the citizens of Wake County,
          helping increase literacy, getting kids excited about reading and learning,
          and making sure all Wake County citizens have access to the internet.</p>
